[[PSR-1]]

- Files MUST use only `<?php` and `<?=` tags.

- Files MUST use only UTF-8 without BOM for PHP code.

- Files SHOULD *either* declare symbols (classes, functions, constants, etc.)
  *or* cause side-effects (e.g. generate output, change .ini settings, etc.)
  but SHOULD NOT do both.

- Namespaces and classes MUST follow an "autoloading" PSR: [[PSR-0], [PSR-4]].

- Class names MUST be declared in `StudlyCaps`.

- Class constants MUST be declared in all upper case with underscore separators.

- Method names MUST be declared in `camelCase`.

[[PSR-2]]

- Code MUST follow a "coding style guide" PSR [[PSR-1]].

- Code MUST use 4 spaces for indenting, not tabs.

- There MUST NOT be a hard limit on line length; the soft limit MUST be 120
  characters; lines SHOULD be 80 characters or less.

- There MUST be one blank line after the `namespace` declaration, and there
  MUST be one blank line after the block of `use` declarations.

- Opening braces for classes MUST go on the next line, and closing braces MUST
  go on the next line after the body.

- Opening braces for methods MUST go on the next line, and closing braces MUST
  go on the next line after the body.

- Visibility MUST be declared on all properties and methods; `abstract` and
  `final` MUST be declared before the visibility; `static` MUST be declared
  after the visibility.

- Control structure keywords MUST have one space after them; method and
  function calls MUST NOT.

- Opening braces for control structures MUST go on the same line, and closing
  braces MUST go on the next line after the body.

- Opening parentheses for control structures MUST NOT have a space after them,
  and closing parentheses for control structures MUST NOT have a space before.
